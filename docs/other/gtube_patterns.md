# GTUBE-like test patterns

Unlike SpamAssassin where GTUBE carries a spam score, in Rspamd it triggers an action and inserts the `GTUBE` symbol. It also skips calling all the modules, even if they have the `explicit_disable` and `ignore_passthrough` flags.

|pattern|action|enabled|
|---|---|---|
|`XJS*C4JDBQADN1.NSBN3*2IDNEN*GTUBE-STANDARD-ANTI-UBE-TEST-EMAIL*C.34X`|`reject`|`Yes`|
|`YJS*C4JDBQADN1.NSBN3*2IDNEN*GTUBE-STANDARD-ANTI-UBE-TEST-EMAIL*C.34X`|`add header`|`No`|
|`ZJS*C4JDBQADN1.NSBN3*2IDNEN*GTUBE-STANDARD-ANTI-UBE-TEST-EMAIL*C.34X`|`rewrite subject`|`No`|
|`AJS*C4JDBQADN1.NSBN3*2IDNEN*GTUBE-STANDARD-ANTI-UBE-TEST-EMAIL*C.34X`|`no action`|`No`|

Because non-reject GTUBE-like patterns can be used to bypass spam filtering they are disabled by default; they can be enabled by setting `gtube_patterns = "all"` in `local.d/options.inc` (since version 3.8) or `enable_test_patterns = true` in older versions (2.3+).

Enabling non-reject GTUBE-like patterns **is NOT recommended for production** usage!

To **disable GTUBE** such that the `reject` pattern wouldn't be applied, set `gtube_patterns = "disable"`.
