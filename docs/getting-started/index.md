## Learning Philosophy

Our documentation follows a **progressive disclosure** approach:

1. **Start with concepts** - Understand before implementing
2. **Build incrementally** - Working system first, optimization later
3. **Learn by doing** - Practical examples with real configurations
4. **Connect to reference** - Link to detailed technical documentation when needed

## Support and Community

As you work through these guides:

- **Join our community** - Get help from other users and developers
- **Report issues** - Help us improve the documentation
- **Share your experience** - Contribute scenarios and solutions
- **Stay updated** - Follow changes and new features

## What's Different About This Guide?

Traditional Rspamd documentation has been reference-focused. This new structure:

- **Answers "how to accomplish X"** instead of just "what parameter Y does"
- **Provides decision frameworks** to help you choose the right approach
- **Includes real-world scenarios** beyond basic setup examples
- **Connects related concepts** so you understand how pieces fit together
- **Offers multiple learning paths** for different user needs

## Ready to Start?

Choose your path above, or if you're unsure, start with **[Understanding Rspamd](understanding-rspamd)** to build the foundation you'll need for everything else.

Remember: **effective spam filtering is a journey, not a destination**. Start with the basics, get a working system, then iterate and improve based on your actual email patterns and requirements.
