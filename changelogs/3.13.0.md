title: "Major Release with Breaking Changes"

## Breaking Changes
- Multiclass Bayes classification with named classes (2–20 classes), processed in a single Redis call per message. ([#5547](https://github.com/rspamd/rspamd/pull/5547))
- Backward compatible with `is_spam`; new configuration supports labeled classes and autolearn.
- Lua API and autolearn support multiclass workflows with class‑aware Redis caching.
- CLI: `rspamc learn_class:transactional …`, `rspamc learn_class:newsletter …`.
- Lua API: `task:get_multiclass_result()` returns class probabilities and confidence.

## Added
- Neural module overhaul to a provider‑based architecture (symbols, LLM embeddings), versioned and backward compatible. ([#5579](https://github.com/rspamd/rspamd/pull/5579))
- Pluggable feature fusion with trained normalization (unit/zscore/none) applied at train and inference.
- Redis‑backed caching for LLM embeddings to control cost and latency.
- Multimap selectors: SA‑style selectors with dedicated `selector` field; integrated with Hyperscan and regex cache. ([#5615](https://github.com/rspamd/rspamd/pull/5615))
- MIME parser automatically detects part types. ([#5619](https://github.com/rspamd/rspamd/pull/5619), [#5608](https://github.com/rspamd/rspamd/pull/5608))
- HTML parser extracts more features for downstream modules.

## Improved
- HTTP timeouts configuration and handling. ([#5614](https://github.com/rspamd/rspamd/pull/5614), [#5603](https://github.com/rspamd/rspamd/pull/5603), [#5601](https://github.com/rspamd/rspamd/pull/5601))
- Upstream reliability with probe mode; reduced need for forced revive.
- DNS nameserver resolution switched to `getaddrinfo`.
- Standardized on C++20; build, test, and CI improvements (including ARM support and modern fallback maps). ([#5592](https://github.com/rspamd/rspamd/pull/5592), [#5598](https://github.com/rspamd/rspamd/pull/5598), [#5580](https://github.com/rspamd/rspamd/pull/5580))
- Regular code cleaning and RPM tweaks.
- WebUI: E2E scan test flows; Bootstrap upgrade; Bayes class management from the web interface. ([#5606](https://github.com/rspamd/rspamd/pull/5606), [#5607](https://github.com/rspamd/rspamd/pull/5607))
- GPT/LLM integrations: improved parameter/prompt handling; initial support for OpenAI GPT‑5 and other models. ([#5612](https://github.com/rspamd/rspamd/pull/5612), [#5572](https://github.com/rspamd/rspamd/pull/5572))

## Fixed
- DCC plugin rewritten and optimized. ([#5602](https://github.com/rspamd/rspamd/pull/5602))
- DKIM relaxed body canonicalization; improved reliability in multimap, WebUI, and configuration. ([#5593](https://github.com/rspamd/rspamd/pull/5593))
- Numerous minor bug fixes and CI/build improvements.
